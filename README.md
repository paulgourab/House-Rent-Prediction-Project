# House-Rent-Prediction-Project
Home Rent Prediction System is an AI-based program that can predict the house 
price by analyzing the location, size of the room, and the total amount of bedroom. Here, we used a dataset that contains various information about houses 
including house prices. Our program predicts rent by analyzing the used dataset.

We used the Linear Regression algorithm. Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised  learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the  relationship between variables and forecasting. Hypothesis function for Linear Regression: y = θ1 + θ2 * x
Here,
x: input
y: labels
θ1: intercept
θ2: coefficient of x
